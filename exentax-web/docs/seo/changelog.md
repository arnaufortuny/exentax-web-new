## 2026-04-16 — SEO overhaul task #4

### Documentation (new in `exentax-web/docs/seo/`)
- `README.md`, `audit-2026.md`, `keyword-map.md`, `editorial-guide.md`,
  `slug-conventions.md`, `internal-linking.md`, `publishing-checklist.md`,
  `changelog.md`.

### Schema / structured data (`server/seo-content.ts`, `server/static.ts`, `client/index.html`)
- BreadcrumbList `item` URLs for `about_llc`, `how_we_work`,
  `our_services`, `faq`, `book` now use `/es/...` localized paths
  instead of unprefixed legacy paths (those returned 404 under the
  known-paths check and were therefore invalid references).
- `about_llc.mainEntityOfPage` now points to `/es/sobre-las-llc`.
- `how_we_work` HowToStep #2 URL now points to `/es/sobre-las-llc`.
- Added `WebSite` schema on every home route (`/`, `/{lang}`) with
  `inLanguage` listing all supported languages and publisher linked
  to the Organization.
- Removed the stale `SearchAction` / `potentialAction` claim from
  `client/index.html` and declined to emit it from `server/static.ts`.
  Rationale: the site does not implement a query-param-driven search
  endpoint today, so asserting a search-action URL template would be
  misleading structured data and risk a manual action.

### Meta / title fixes (`server/seo-content.ts`)
- German `about_llc` title shortened from 70 → 54 chars
  ("US-LLC für Nicht-Residenten · Leitfaden 2026 | Exentax") so it no
  longer truncates in the SERP.

### Indexation / redirects (`server/index.ts`)
- Added a 301-redirect middleware that consolidates the legacy
  unprefixed Spanish URLs into their canonical `/es/...` equivalents:
  - `/sobre-las-llc`, `/como-trabajamos`, `/nuestros-servicios`,
    `/servicios`, `/preguntas-frecuentes`, `/agendar`, `/blog`,
    `/legal/terminos`, `/legal/privacidad`, `/legal/cookies`,
    `/legal/reembolsos`, `/legal/disclaimer`.
  - Every `/blog/<slug>` 301s to `/es/blog/<slug>`.
- Eliminates the duplicate-content risk flagged in audit §2.1 and
  consolidates link equity on the canonical language-prefixed URLs.

### Internal linking (`server/static.ts`, `client/src/data/blog-related.ts`)
- Extended the server-side `markdownToHtml` converter to render
  `[anchor](href)` markdown as `<a href="href">anchor</a>`. This
  enables authors to embed internal links inside blog content and
  have them appear in the prerendered SEO copy picked up by crawlers.
  See `docs/seo/internal-linking.md`.
- Added `client/src/data/blog-related.ts` — a deterministic
  `getRelatedPosts(slug, lang, limit)` function that selects the
  topically nearest posts (same category, closest publish date,
  cross-category fallback) with localized slugs, titles and excerpts.
- Wired `getRelatedPosts` into the blog-article SEO prerender in
  `server/static.ts`. Every blog article now emits a localized
  "Related articles" `<aside>` with 3 internal links, strengthening
  topical clustering and distributing link equity across the blog.

### Multilingual on-page rewrites (`server/seo-content.ts`, `server/static.ts`)
- Added `PAGE_SEO_CONTENT_I18N: Partial<Record<SupportedLang,
  Partial<Record<RouteKey, string>>>>` as a language-aware
  companion to the existing Spanish `PAGE_SEO_CONTENT` map.
- Shipped localized prerender copy for all six main pages —
  `home`, `about_llc`, `how_we_work`, `our_services`, `faq`, `book`
  — in **all five non-Spanish languages** (`en`, `fr`, `de`, `pt`,
  `ca`). Each locale has its own keyword-dense H1/H2/H3, culturally
  adapted for the target market (e.g. German mentions FATCA/CRS
  explicitly, Portuguese references Brazilian and Portuguese
  clients, Catalan uses the pan-Catalan register).
- `injectMeta` now selects the language-appropriate prerender for
  main pages with a Spanish fallback that should no longer trigger
  on the six main pages in any supported language.

### Performance / Core Web Vitals
- `client/index.html`: removed six stale
  `<link rel="preload" as="image">` entries pointing at
  below-the-fold partner-carousel logos. They were stealing
  bandwidth from the LCP candidate on mobile. Replaced with a
  dated comment block explaining why.
- `client/src/components/sections/BanksCarousel.tsx`: all carousel
  images now use `loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"
  decoding="async"`. Previously the first 10 entries were
  `loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"` despite always being
  below the fold, which inflated TBT on mobile.
- `docs/seo/performance-audit.md` added with the measurement
  procedure, baseline Lighthouse numbers, and projected
  post-change scores for the four canonical templates
  (`/es`, `/es/sobre-las-llc`, `/es/blog`, a blog post).

### Home schema coverage fix
- `server/static.ts`: `ProfessionalService` and `WebSite` JSON-LD
  blocks are now gated on the local `routeKey` variable instead of
  `resolvedRoute?.key`. `resolveServerRoute("/")` returns null in
  this routing model, so the previous condition silently skipped
  schema injection on the root URL. Verified by curl — both `/`
  and every `/{lang}` now emit both schema blocks.

### Robots (`server/routes/public.ts`)
- Extended `robots.txt` with `Disallow` rules for the common tracking
  query-string variants (`ref`, `utm_*`, `gclid`, `fbclid`, `mc_cid`,
  `mc_eid`) to prevent crawl-budget leakage through attribution
  duplicates.

## Prior state (baseline before task #4)

- 58 blog posts, full i18n across 6 languages.
- Hreflang reciprocal on all main pages, blog index, and blog posts.
- Sitemap with per-URL `xhtml:link rel="alternate"` and `x-default`.
- Robots.txt disallowing `/api/`, `/admin/`, `/links`, `/start`, `/booking/`.
- Schemas: Organization, ProfessionalService, Article + Speakable (hub),
  HowTo, 3× Product + AggregateRating, OfferCatalog, Service, FAQPage,
  BreadcrumbList (every main page and blog post).
- Server-side meta injection with 200-entry LRU cache.
- Prerendered SEO content for every main page and blog post.
